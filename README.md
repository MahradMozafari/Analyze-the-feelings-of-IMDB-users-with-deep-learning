# Analyze the Feelings of IMDB Users with Deep Learning

This project focuses on analyzing the sentiments expressed by IMDB users through their comments using deep learning techniques. The goal is to understand and classify user sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral, leveraging advanced deep learning models for sentiment analysis.

## Features

- **Data Exploration:** Analyzing and visualizing the IMDB users' comments dataset.
- **Deep Learning Models:** Implementing and training deep learning models for sentiment classification.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Classifying comments into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

## Prerequisites
